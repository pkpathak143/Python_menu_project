# Python_menu_project
This project is started now, I will work on it and will update here also

Till now in this project we have:
1. Some basic linux commands 
2. Configure web server (httpd)
3. Hadoop 
4. Docker 

Here, we have option to run it locally but soon i'll also add to run it remotely

All thanks to my mentor Mr. Vimal Daga Sir,
